please implement morale systems in the early game - propose certain ideas for it.

also money, can we add a race entry fee so that we cant just race without any penalty, harder races should cost more ofc.

add scrolling for season summary screen. otherwise the cards are stacked too tall and cut off the screen.

update our README.md and in game info screen to reflect new help info.
